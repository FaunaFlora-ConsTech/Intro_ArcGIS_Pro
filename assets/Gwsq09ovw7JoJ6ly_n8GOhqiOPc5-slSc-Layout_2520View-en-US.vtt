90c45a90-d0d5-4dba-b8e6-dfbe71974664-0
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.081
Hopefully now you've managed to
change the symbology of the land

90c45a90-d0d5-4dba-b8e6-dfbe71974664-1
00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:09.704
cover raster and it looks
something a little bit like

90c45a90-d0d5-4dba-b8e6-dfbe71974664-2
00:00:09.704 --> 00:00:10.040
this.

6875533d-53d7-469c-9ca8-cdf50c450f39-0
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.156
So we can see in our contents
pane we have the boxes of

6875533d-53d7-469c-9ca8-cdf50c450f39-1
00:00:14.156 --> 00:00:18.352
different colours and we've got
the labels next to each box

6875533d-53d7-469c-9ca8-cdf50c450f39-2
00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:21.080
telling us what land cover type
it is.

c9fa2da3-2250-47dd-a6d1-ff412270ac43-0
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.160
So now let's go ahead and add
the vector data layers on top.

b244d555-d5b9-439d-8a94-a4c1a65889eb-0
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.305
Our map is starting to take
shape here, so let's get it

b244d555-d5b9-439d-8a94-a4c1a65889eb-1
00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:32.440
ready to be exported.

068b80e9-2a4d-4ea0-a399-e1bc5b4bd226-0
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.095
So when you're working on a
project in Arcgis Pro and you

068b80e9-2a4d-4ea0-a399-e1bc5b4bd226-1
00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:39.182
want to get a map ready to
export or print, we need to

068b80e9-2a4d-4ea0-a399-e1bc5b4bd226-2
00:00:39.182 --> 00:00:40.080
create a layout.

ff55e032-a119-47ae-ab24-eee926fb7ddd-0
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:50.450
So to do this you want to go
into the Insert tab and click on

ff55e032-a119-47ae-ab24-eee926fb7ddd-1
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.220
New Layout.

aae07c00-2183-4b4c-b188-28a3737693de-0
00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.780
This is going to bring up some
page size options and so we're

aae07c00-2183-4b4c-b188-28a3737693de-1
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.954
going to go with A4 portrait and
now we have our blank page to

aae07c00-2183-4b4c-b188-28a3737693de-2
00:01:09.954 --> 00:01:11.890
add our map onto.

0d2ae723-5c95-442a-b501-2013e41844c4-0
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.665
So to add our map we want to go
into insert and then click on

0d2ae723-5c95-442a-b501-2013e41844c4-1
00:01:16.665 --> 00:01:17.410
Map frame.

dd4b3358-7c21-47e3-af43-e5b6406e7583-0
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.346
Now we can choose the map that
we want and this will give our

dd4b3358-7c21-47e3-af43-e5b6406e7583-1
00:01:23.346 --> 00:01:26.690
mouse the tool to draw it onto
our page.

8e00fd69-1b11-4145-8cb3-7b476055b73d-0
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.342
So draw a box wherever you like
and now you have your map in

8e00fd69-1b11-4145-8cb3-7b476055b73d-1
00:01:35.342 --> 00:01:37.600
your layout page.

40f2b987-9a3b-4964-bb48-b6a89595cc1c-0
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.189
You can resize it to how you
want and also move it around the

40f2b987-9a3b-4964-bb48-b6a89595cc1c-1
00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:42.560
page.

fb2696e0-e96f-4675-917a-17dd143b366e-0
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.225
But don't worry too much if the
actual view that you have of

fb2696e0-e96f-4675-917a-17dd143b366e-1
00:01:46.225 --> 00:01:49.650
your map isn't in exactly the
right place, as we're going to

fb2696e0-e96f-4675-917a-17dd143b366e-2
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.560
be going over how to change
this.

d01bb78a-922c-4420-aad9-16ca847cb617-0
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.765
And at this point you might have
noticed that now we're in a

d01bb78a-922c-4420-aad9-16ca847cb617-1
00:01:57.765 --> 00:02:01.363
layout view, some of the buttons
within the main ribbon pane have

d01bb78a-922c-4420-aad9-16ca847cb617-2
00:02:01.363 --> 00:02:01.799
changed.

32ffa73f-16cb-4a6d-865d-15c4aef789a8-0
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.154
And so we're going to go over
what new buttons we have and

32ffa73f-16cb-4a6d-865d-15c4aef789a8-1
00:02:05.154 --> 00:02:06.040
what they can do.

bfd93457-7b46-4585-8369-edd072edf946-0
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.053
So if we clicked back on our
map, we can see that the buttons

bfd93457-7b46-4585-8369-edd072edf946-1
00:02:12.053 --> 00:02:13.840
changed back to how they were.

2f8ef6d9-52af-42c4-a542-1fc6819ca523-0
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.046
So we need to be within the
layout view to access the layout

2f8ef6d9-52af-42c4-a542-1fc6819ca523-1
00:02:18.046 --> 00:02:18.520
buttons.

5af066f7-5a62-4ed9-b521-0c2ba2d954cf-0
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.374
The first thing we're going to
take a look at is this layout

5af066f7-5a62-4ed9-b521-0c2ba2d954cf-1
00:02:26.374 --> 00:02:30.769
tab that we now have where we
normally have the map tab and so

5af066f7-5a62-4ed9-b521-0c2ba2d954cf-2
00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.233
the first new section we can see
is Navigate and in navigate we

5af066f7-5a62-4ed9-b521-0c2ba2d954cf-3
00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:39.000
can use these buttons to move
around the layout page.

0b06eca8-2671-4eb6-81fb-a27bdbf99ab6-0
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.966
So if we clicked on the navigate
button we can now move our

0b06eca8-2671-4eb6-81fb-a27bdbf99ab6-1
00:02:42.966 --> 00:02:46.900
layout page around and the other
buttons we have here are for

0b06eca8-2671-4eb6-81fb-a27bdbf99ab6-2
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.360
different zoom options.

1d8fa80f-1516-4255-96a2-e88f9f37c8ae-0
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.195
The next section we have is
Elements and in elements we have

1d8fa80f-1516-4255-96a2-e88f9f37c8ae-1
00:02:53.195 --> 00:02:57.011
select tools to select our map
frame and also the other

1d8fa80f-1516-4255-96a2-e88f9f37c8ae-2
00:02:57.011 --> 00:02:59.600
elements that we add onto our
layout.

29718cd4-115c-4f48-91ae-a43a42ed3c27-0
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.447
in page set up we could change
our layout page to be portrait

29718cd4-115c-4f48-91ae-a43a42ed3c27-1
00:03:05.447 --> 00:03:09.673
or landscape and we also have
options to change the size of

29718cd4-115c-4f48-91ae-a43a42ed3c27-2
00:03:09.673 --> 00:03:14.040
our page and then in show we
have toggle boxes to turn rulers

29718cd4-115c-4f48-91ae-a43a42ed3c27-3
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.520
and guides on or off.

e8ffcbf7-5043-40cf-9f22-bf5cb19a30dd-0
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.251
The guides help us align things
in the layout and the rulers are

e8ffcbf7-5043-40cf-9f22-bf5cb19a30dd-1
00:03:20.251 --> 00:03:23.688
the measurements that you can
see around the sides of the

e8ffcbf7-5043-40cf-9f22-bf5cb19a30dd-2
00:03:23.688 --> 00:03:24.400
layout page.

6da174d1-36e4-4247-9acf-d1f68fc1821e-0
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.892
The next thing we're going to
take a look at is activating our

6da174d1-36e4-4247-9acf-d1f68fc1821e-1
00:03:30.892 --> 00:03:31.440
map frame.

3b441cd2-8c3f-4640-bdd4-468008aac38e-0
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.737
And so what this means is we can
turn on the map within our map

3b441cd2-8c3f-4640-bdd4-468008aac38e-1
00:03:36.737 --> 00:03:40.200
frame and use it as if we were
in the map view.

f012128b-402f-4060-a719-87a31c14804b-0
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.396
So if we click on the activate
button, we can now move inside

f012128b-402f-4060-a719-87a31c14804b-1
00:03:45.396 --> 00:03:50.502
of our map frame and you can see
that the buttons at the top have

f012128b-402f-4060-a719-87a31c14804b-2
00:03:50.502 --> 00:03:53.520
changed as if we're in map view
again.

e7876cda-c66a-42d3-99c9-4c56c9f1c8fc-0
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.360
And so we can also access these
map buttons.

118b883a-5769-45fe-88ab-5ec20e541a13-0
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.064
So move your map to how you want
and once you're happy with it,

118b883a-5769-45fe-88ab-5ec20e541a13-1
00:04:03.064 --> 00:04:05.000
we can close the activation.

f8b19c36-1a6e-4d20-bb08-e52b2ca65432-0
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.351
So to do that, we're going to go
to the Layout button at the top

f8b19c36-1a6e-4d20-bb08-e52b2ca65432-1
00:04:09.351 --> 00:04:11.360
and then hit close activation.

dcdb8519-5bbe-4dd3-ac43-dadf8dbe910d-0
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.093
And now we've covered most of
the buttons in the Layout tab,

dcdb8519-5bbe-4dd3-ac43-dadf8dbe910d-1
00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:23.800
so we'll go and look at what has
changed within the Insert tab.

10c4f93b-71ab-457a-ac2e-a3dab2800243-0
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.860
The Project section has stayed
the same, so we don't need to

10c4f93b-71ab-457a-ac2e-a3dab2800243-1
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.680
worry about that.

0fc20a69-d9fc-4e83-8230-e9ed0a765026-0
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.943
But here we now have a section
on map frames and this is where

0fc20a69-d9fc-4e83-8230-e9ed0a765026-1
00:04:32.943 --> 00:04:35.280
we went to add our map frame in
initially.

ec2afac2-00ef-4982-94b0-8027397a9906-0
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.736
So you could also add a map
frame of a different shape by

ec2afac2-00ef-4982-94b0-8027397a9906-1
00:04:41.736 --> 00:04:46.229
clicking here and by clicking on
grid we can add grid lines to

ec2afac2-00ef-4982-94b0-8027397a9906-2
00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:46.800
our map.

4ea9936b-47bc-4948-a5ab-1b392f5dc179-0
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.643
So we're going to choose the
first one here and now we have

4ea9936b-47bc-4948-a5ab-1b392f5dc179-1
00:04:52.643 --> 00:04:58.279
grid lines showing the longitude
and latitude on our map. In map

4ea9936b-47bc-4948-a5ab-1b392f5dc179-2
00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.799
frames

4f93016b-e915-4194-937b-a81b612ed11f-0
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.720
we've also got a button on map
series as well.

a7be3d31-3b15-4d5d-bf5c-b2727dd9b119-0
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.534
If you wanted to change the grid
lines that we added and set it

a7be3d31-3b15-4d5d-bf5c-b2727dd9b119-1
00:05:08.534 --> 00:05:13.120
to your preferences, then you
can right click on the grids in

a7be3d31-3b15-4d5d-bf5c-b2727dd9b119-2
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.336
your contents pane and then
click on properties and this

a7be3d31-3b15-4d5d-bf5c-b2727dd9b119-3
00:05:17.336 --> 00:05:21.331
will bring up the element pane
where you can set your

a7be3d31-3b15-4d5d-bf5c-b2727dd9b119-4
00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:25.400
preferences for your grid lines.
Within the Insert tab

dc9648de-4afa-482a-906e-4457037e9901-0
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.716
here we also now have map
surrounds and so this is where

dc9648de-4afa-482a-906e-4457037e9901-1
00:05:28.716 --> 00:05:31.800
you can add some really useful
things onto your map.

2f1d4383-0b7f-4126-877f-892e6e68b530-0
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.479
So the first thing we're going
to take a look at is adding a

2f1d4383-0b7f-4126-877f-892e6e68b530-1
00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:34.920
north arrow.

02e93380-af35-4b56-816e-7961305e6617-0
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.537
This isn't normally necessary if
your map is already orientated

02e93380-af35-4b56-816e-7961305e6617-1
00:05:38.537 --> 00:05:41.680
north but we're going to take a
look at how to do it anyway.

93462f6f-9828-4f1c-a72d-4d8d046cd24b-0
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.660
So you would click on the button
and now you can choose which

93462f6f-9828-4f1c-a72d-4d8d046cd24b-1
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.440
north arrow you want to add.

a264dc8c-0d3e-4ab3-a6f9-362d43e897aa-0
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.314
I'm going to choose this one
here and then you can draw it on

a264dc8c-0d3e-4ab3-a6f9-362d43e897aa-1
00:05:58.314 --> 00:06:01.410
to your map and resize it to how
you want.

ae5c4219-4d65-4805-80e8-8f83fc77a502-0
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.200
And again, just like the grids,
you can go into your contents

ae5c4219-4d65-4805-80e8-8f83fc77a502-1
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.230
pane, right click on the north
arrow you just added and go on

ae5c4219-4d65-4805-80e8-8f83fc77a502-2
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.880
properties

2b184d1d-55c5-404c-b9f2-a2c1a80f3afe-0
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.424
if you want to change it to suit
your preferences more. We're

2b184d1d-55c5-404c-b9f2-a2c1a80f3afe-1
00:06:17.424 --> 00:06:21.360
going to take a look at adding a
scale bar.

e210adf6-4029-4172-8f9c-74e7c3514d58-0
00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.346
So we click on the scale bar
button and then we can choose

e210adf6-4029-4172-8f9c-74e7c3514d58-1
00:06:25.346 --> 00:06:29.739
which scale we want to add, and
then we're going to draw it onto

e210adf6-4029-4172-8f9c-74e7c3514d58-2
00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:30.280
our map.

b62cf070-5d6e-4840-b665-00e2fec78fea-0
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.880
And again, you can resize it or
move it to where you want.

9ac53bca-9eca-4d8e-aba8-2cd4f7d3e05d-0
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.818
You can also right click on your
scale bar in the contents and go

9ac53bca-9eca-4d8e-aba8-2cd4f7d3e05d-1
00:06:44.818 --> 00:06:48.320
to the properties. In map
surrounds

304a6542-700c-489f-908c-a2b78f3b60f1-0
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.120
we can also add a legend, a
chart frame or a table.

ab5ecad7-03b4-4eab-b596-e3461b07ce1d-0
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.670
And then we also have a graphics
and text section in the Insert

ab5ecad7-03b4-4eab-b596-e3461b07ce1d-1
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.240
tab so we can add in graphics
and text onto our map.

766e43b7-845b-4f6c-b835-2d01ba9f75c3-0
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.707
And that's most of the important
buttons that we now have within

766e43b7-845b-4f6c-b835-2d01ba9f75c3-1
00:07:07.707 --> 00:07:08.480
layout view.

640cbc9a-ee5a-4123-9de4-83a75ed7197f-0
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.430
An important note just to say
here, you can access your layout

640cbc9a-ee5a-4123-9de4-83a75ed7197f-1
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.520
within your catalog.

091939e8-73bb-4c5e-9fb3-f893d099dc2f-0
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.012
This is really useful if you
accidentally shut your layout in

091939e8-73bb-4c5e-9fb3-f893d099dc2f-1
00:07:17.012 --> 00:07:20.276
your project, then you can still
access it in your catalog and

091939e8-73bb-4c5e-9fb3-f893d099dc2f-2
00:07:20.276 --> 00:07:21.520
you can open it back up.

7bc4bf48-c049-4b52-acd3-beddbb4f45eb-0
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.637
So now have a go at creating
your own layout and playing

7bc4bf48-c049-4b52-acd3-beddbb4f45eb-1
00:07:27.637 --> 00:07:30.863
around with some of the buttons
that you have access to in

7bc4bf48-c049-4b52-acd3-beddbb4f45eb-2
00:07:30.863 --> 00:07:31.520
layout view.
