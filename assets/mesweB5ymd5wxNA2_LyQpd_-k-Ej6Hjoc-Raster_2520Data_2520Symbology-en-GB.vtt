3a6e749a-6139-46ae-9900-72d6cb0851fd-0
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.720
So now we know how to look at
the symbology for our vector

3a6e749a-6139-46ae-9900-72d6cb0851fd-1
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.470
data layers and how to change
these to what we want.

5fcf9f44-81a6-48f0-b4b7-e43f24932a62-0
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.319
Will now take a look at the
raster data layers. So we're

5fcf9f44-81a6-48f0-b4b7-e43f24932a62-1
00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:13.750
going to toggle off the vector
data layers.

e16531f6-4b7c-4d6c-ab99-9f208aa42222-0
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.006
I'm going to take a look at the
rasters and we can tell that

e16531f6-4b7c-4d6c-ab99-9f208aa42222-1
00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:20.530
these are rasters because if we
zoom in on them

72acaf43-5cac-43bd-9545-bf68ab805b89-0
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.815
we can see that they're layers
made-up of lots of different

72acaf43-5cac-43bd-9545-bf68ab805b89-1
00:00:24.815 --> 00:00:26.200
pixels of different colours.

9b14d887-e466-478b-b741-9e4c3e0774fa-0
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.160
It's the same for the elevation
raster layer as well,

080ec9b9-305c-4fd9-a88f-575a14fd9ebc-0
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.538
and so we'll start off taking a
look at the symbology for this

080ec9b9-305c-4fd9-a88f-575a14fd9ebc-1
00:00:40.538 --> 00:00:44.451
elevation layer. At the moment
we can see it looks a little

080ec9b9-305c-4fd9-a88f-575a14fd9ebc-2
00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:48.299
crazy and the reason why is
because when we put this layer

080ec9b9-305c-4fd9-a88f-575a14fd9ebc-3
00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:51.299
into Arcgis Pro it's
automatically given that

080ec9b9-305c-4fd9-a88f-575a14fd9ebc-4
00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:55.277
elevation layer unique values
for each elevation and so it's

080ec9b9-305c-4fd9-a88f-575a14fd9ebc-5
00:00:55.277 --> 00:00:59.386
given us a coloured box for 380
metres for example, and then a

080ec9b9-305c-4fd9-a88f-575a14fd9ebc-6
00:00:59.386 --> 00:01:02.777
coloured box for 381 metres
going up to the highest

080ec9b9-305c-4fd9-a88f-575a14fd9ebc-7
00:01:02.777 --> 00:01:03.430
elevation.

c7ee4368-b5ef-47bb-ab05-3b19b0e411ec-0
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.287
This isn't showing elevation
very well and we can't tell from

c7ee4368-b5ef-47bb-ab05-3b19b0e411ec-1
00:01:07.287 --> 00:01:10.547
looking at this layer what it's
trying to show us. And so we're

c7ee4368-b5ef-47bb-ab05-3b19b0e411ec-2
00:01:10.547 --> 00:01:12.330
going to change this in
symbology.

585085e0-79fe-4457-976f-f3a9867cf974-0
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.951
But first of all, we want to
zoom back out so we can see the

585085e0-79fe-4457-976f-f3a9867cf974-1
00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:21.480
full extent of the layer. And so
to do that, we're going to right

585085e0-79fe-4457-976f-f3a9867cf974-2
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.710
click on our data layer

967f5593-c76b-4c58-8630-0317207c22bd-0
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.860
and then click on zoom to layer.

d18dd709-94ae-4af5-b969-901161fcc3cd-0
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.943
OK, now let's take a look at
changing the symbology for this

d18dd709-94ae-4af5-b969-901161fcc3cd-1
00:01:32.943 --> 00:01:36.576
data layer. And so we're going
to right click and then click on

d18dd709-94ae-4af5-b969-901161fcc3cd-2
00:01:36.576 --> 00:01:39.870
symbology like we did for the
vector data layers as well.

0f410216-f3c3-4750-837f-32740ee46062-0
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.327
So what we're going to change is
this box here where it says

0f410216-f3c3-4750-837f-32740ee46062-1
00:01:47.327 --> 00:01:50.805
unique values. We want to change
this as these unique values

0f410216-f3c3-4750-837f-32740ee46062-2
00:01:50.805 --> 00:01:53.826
aren't representing our
continuous raster layer very

0f410216-f3c3-4750-837f-32740ee46062-3
00:01:53.826 --> 00:01:56.619
well. So we're going to go on
the drop down box.

4a2e3a9d-dd73-4db1-b8a4-10fa7e52ce82-0
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.930
And we are going to choose
stretch instead.

8757d2d3-f660-4992-a792-56491873e654-0
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.686
And if we look in our contents
now, we can see that this has

8757d2d3-f660-4992-a792-56491873e654-1
00:02:07.686 --> 00:02:12.081
changed the symbology so that
the pixels are now on a scale of

8757d2d3-f660-4992-a792-56491873e654-2
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:15.361
colour, where black is
representing the lowest

8757d2d3-f660-4992-a792-56491873e654-3
00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:19.198
elevation and white is
representing 1386 metres. So we

8757d2d3-f660-4992-a792-56491873e654-4
00:02:19.198 --> 00:02:23.385
can see that we've got a layer
here that's representing our

8757d2d3-f660-4992-a792-56491873e654-5
00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:24.990
elevation a lot better.

9f49ad34-a728-4811-b84f-55d64f134503-0
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.551
We can change the symbology of
this layer even further by

9f49ad34-a728-4811-b84f-55d64f134503-1
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.310
changing the colour scheme here

2417be3d-b190-412c-bc3e-f951187165f9-0
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.300
And so if we click on this box

15cb04cc-7260-44b1-a286-d8665747744f-0
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.556
we can see that it's loaded up
with some pre-made colour

15cb04cc-7260-44b1-a286-d8665747744f-1
00:02:42.556 --> 00:02:44.260
schemes from Arcgis Pro.

c17e90ff-681f-4a3b-abf2-5e2ac05fc9c7-0
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.125
And so you can have a scroll
through these and you can also

c17e90ff-681f-4a3b-abf2-5e2ac05fc9c7-1
00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:50.660
hover your mouse over them to
see what they're named.

1bed8335-9b38-466b-b631-366707e4e62e-0
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.771
If we scroll down we can find
some that have been made

1bed8335-9b38-466b-b631-366707e4e62e-1
00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:56.250
specifically for elevation.

e62bd36d-6b00-4ada-a09d-9c8b69e0c052-0
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.170
So we're going to choose
elevation #4

b681126a-f435-43f1-b3c4-c9fca11d7d58-0
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.873
and now the symbology of this
layer is representing elevation

b681126a-f435-43f1-b3c4-c9fca11d7d58-1
00:03:08.873 --> 00:03:12.515
much better. So let's take a
look at the other raster, land

b681126a-f435-43f1-b3c4-c9fca11d7d58-2
00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:12.880
cover.

37ca6d4e-2ff8-4804-ac58-2da0a7759b94-0
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.922
So this raster is discrete, and
that's because we've got pixels

37ca6d4e-2ff8-4804-ac58-2da0a7759b94-1
00:03:24.922 --> 00:03:29.455
of colours that are representing
a distinct category. So you can

37ca6d4e-2ff8-4804-ac58-2da0a7759b94-2
00:03:29.455 --> 00:03:33.570
see on the left that we've got
10 different coloured boxes

16a1b170-ccb9-4f00-953e-88539c527533-0
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.600
and these are all representing a
different type of land cover.

066d67c2-6607-47d9-bfd6-dbcd9f8c5ff7-0
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.450
So now we'll take a look at the
symbology of this layer, right

066d67c2-6607-47d9-bfd6-dbcd9f8c5ff7-1
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.645
click and click on symbology
again to get the pane come back

066d67c2-6607-47d9-bfd6-dbcd9f8c5ff7-2
00:03:45.645 --> 00:03:45.750
up

32739a82-f4f4-4f6a-9645-0f745364306a-0
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.392
and where it says Unique values
we're going to leave this how it

32739a82-f4f4-4f6a-9645-0f745364306a-1
00:03:50.392 --> 00:03:53.170
is because this is representing
our discrete raster well,

5bcc7a8e-8420-4834-9662-0fee68c9a34a-0
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.332
but what we're going to take a
look at is each of the coloured

5bcc7a8e-8420-4834-9662-0fee68c9a34a-1
00:03:57.332 --> 00:04:00.494
boxes and we're going to have a
go at changing the colours and

5bcc7a8e-8420-4834-9662-0fee68c9a34a-2
00:04:00.494 --> 00:04:01.800
also the label of the box.

b463e67d-abfb-4576-9c9b-2fdba2aaf13b-0
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.546
So for the top row here where it
has a value of 0, this is

b463e67d-abfb-4576-9c9b-2fdba2aaf13b-1
00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.900
representing where there's no
data.

e86263e5-3173-4ee4-a2a5-c8a9bdc9f318-0
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.940
So for the colour we can just
change this to have no colour

7ff5bd62-7c42-460f-8f3c-e9133cbe0e77-0
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.710
by going here

fd09f3f1-1217-4db2-900a-b7da0e5e48a4-0
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.175
and now if we take a look in the
contents we can see that the

fd09f3f1-1217-4db2-900a-b7da0e5e48a4-1
00:04:21.175 --> 00:04:23.400
coloured box has changed to have
no colour.

26f013db-f1f3-4480-96d6-bdd4b47921b6-0
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.964
And now we're going to change
the label just by clicking twice

26f013db-f1f3-4480-96d6-bdd4b47921b6-1
00:04:27.964 --> 00:04:31.612
in the box that we want to
change, and we're going to type

26f013db-f1f3-4480-96d6-bdd4b47921b6-2
00:04:31.612 --> 00:04:33.900
in no data and hit the enter
button.

a1612068-7963-48e1-be62-9f08245ef442-0
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.008
And now if you look in the
contents again, we can see that

a1612068-7963-48e1-be62-9f08245ef442-1
00:04:39.008 --> 00:04:42.320
we've had our label come up
showing that where there's no

a1612068-7963-48e1-be62-9f08245ef442-2
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.290
colour it means that there's no
data on land cover.

8658ebe4-b0ad-4802-a9f3-891875de5c09-0
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.718
Now have a go at changing the
rest of yourself. The

8658ebe4-b0ad-4802-a9f3-891875de5c09-1
00:04:48.718 --> 00:04:50.850
information you need will be
below this video.
