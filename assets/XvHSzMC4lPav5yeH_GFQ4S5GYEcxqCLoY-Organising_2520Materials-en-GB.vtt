00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.645
When setting up an Arcgis Pro
project, the first thing you

aea2f762-9ebe-466a-aad7-52323195df0a-1
00:00:07.645 --> 00:00:11.293
want to do is set up a folder
for your materials. That's going

aea2f762-9ebe-466a-aad7-52323195df0a-2
00:00:11.293 --> 00:00:13.030
to be easy to access and find.

413bb187-e3bd-4008-9859-30b154648674-0
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.904
You should do this even if you
don't have your materials yet,

413bb187-e3bd-4008-9859-30b154648674-1
00:00:16.904 --> 00:00:19.939
as it's going to give you a
place to store them. For this

413bb187-e3bd-4008-9859-30b154648674-2
00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.288
tutorial though, you should have
hopefully have downloaded this

413bb187-e3bd-4008-9859-30b154648674-3
00:00:23.288 --> 00:00:26.428
folder that contains all the
materials that you're going to

413bb187-e3bd-4008-9859-30b154648674-4
00:00:26.428 --> 00:00:29.149
need for this course. If you
don't have this folder

413bb187-e3bd-4008-9859-30b154648674-5
00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.499
downloaded then just exit this
video, scroll back up the lesson

413bb187-e3bd-4008-9859-30b154648674-6
00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:35.743
and you should find the button
that you need to download this

413bb187-e3bd-4008-9859-30b154648674-7
00:00:35.743 --> 00:00:36.109
folder.

533422cd-8238-4536-88c3-20743bf561f1-0
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.012
So hopefully you've got it
downloaded and it's in your

533422cd-8238-4536-88c3-20743bf561f1-1
00:00:41.012 --> 00:00:44.898
downloads here. If it's not in
Downloads, then just find where

533422cd-8238-4536-88c3-20743bf561f1-2
00:00:44.898 --> 00:00:46.440
it is and navigate to it.

2909c91f-f1e2-445c-bc58-c746f6e2e5f3-0
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.343
And what we're going to do now
is create our folder to put the

2909c91f-f1e2-445c-bc58-c746f6e2e5f3-1
00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:54.350
materials that are within this
compressed folder into.

965d02f2-fa79-4667-ad23-d8658f7a635e-0
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.270
So I'm going to go onto my
OneDrive

cba2494a-51f3-47a1-9d20-7cca9ee5a5aa-0
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.177
and my Documents and then I'm
going to create a new folder. So

cba2494a-51f3-47a1-9d20-7cca9ee5a5aa-1
00:01:02.177 --> 00:01:03.470
I'm going to right click,

7477b116-3c24-498e-8ff0-da9df8e23e22-0
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.620
go down to new

f7baf8e4-fd06-4ec6-a29e-4380d0b96da4-0
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.880
click folder

f4c32812-486b-477e-8fed-7f46f80e8fb6-0
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.400
and name it Intro

c36da56c-d284-4a9f-b2d8-12d4563f40cc-0
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.530
Arc GIS Pro

5f901020-a478-458c-8055-c416a4a8cd4d-0
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.190
and then I'm going to go into
this folder.

4c151e50-3d2e-41ab-be50-dff5fdbc5848-0
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.920
So now we can drag across

ac94cd98-7b99-460b-abe9-b5c804d12577-0
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.260
the folder that we downloaded
into our new folder

042aaca1-c5b8-4a5f-b524-633ed40fa656-0
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.473
and we're going to unzip it to
be able to access all the

042aaca1-c5b8-4a5f-b524-633ed40fa656-1
00:01:31.473 --> 00:01:34.940
materials that are inside it. So
we're going to right click

8df54577-f179-4415-9a84-61f36ab4aca8-0
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.000
and we're going to go and
extract all

d89e5613-0ffc-4126-a3f1-8636377ea47c-0
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.938
and then when you have this pop
up come up you can just delete

d89e5613-0ffc-4126-a3f1-8636377ea47c-1
00:01:43.938 --> 00:01:46.610
the part that has the name of
the folder.

f4445e96-3b61-40dc-aacf-da2f83935ddf-0
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.669
Otherwise, this just creates
another folder that you don't

f4445e96-3b61-40dc-aacf-da2f83935ddf-1
00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.890
need

d41805f1-b7e7-457d-b0ff-207249087328-0
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.480
and click extract.

f6a6f5af-c7b0-4a76-a7ed-6893d6a2b13a-0
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.900
OK, so we've got our extracted
folder here and if we go into it

a7835c6f-65c5-4581-81f7-53800a8a2da5-0
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.550
we can see all of our materials
here

f7aefaf7-f262-464a-b6fc-d91ce023a9ba-0
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.166
and then we just go back out.
What we can do now is delete the

f7aefaf7-f262-464a-b6fc-d91ce023a9ba-1
00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:18.830
other folder,

331fb7b9-ad3d-4fb0-b70c-c15dcaac6076-0
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.800
the compressed one.

905164da-0cb0-4538-b3ed-22562c580187-0
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.974
And what's really important is
to rename your folders so that

905164da-0cb0-4538-b3ed-22562c580187-1
00:02:28.974 --> 00:02:32.598
they're really clear and you
know what's in them. So this

905164da-0cb0-4538-b3ed-22562c580187-2
00:02:32.598 --> 00:02:35.909
isn't very clear at the moment.
So let's rename this

5737fa8e-f8a6-4551-8122-042959c4046a-0
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.200
and name it Materials.

94594c63-9349-4427-b9eb-aa5ab213407c-0
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.754
So now if we go back into our
documents, we can see we can

94594c63-9349-4427-b9eb-aa5ab213407c-1
00:02:46.754 --> 00:02:50.440
click on Intro to Arcgis Pro and
then we have our materials here

f9a5c67d-8888-4bc3-b7c3-0521d67a87ea-0
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.058
that all the materials that
we're going to need for this

f9a5c67d-8888-4bc3-b7c3-0521d67a87ea-1
00:02:54.058 --> 00:02:54.300
course.
