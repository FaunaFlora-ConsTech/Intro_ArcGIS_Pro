00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.891
We have set up our project and
now we're going to add some data

bd33ad67-c5a5-4abc-8ad9-82b2c6782d3a-1
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:08.316
into it. There are a few ways we
could do this and in this video

bd33ad67-c5a5-4abc-8ad9-82b2c6782d3a-2
00:00:08.316 --> 00:00:11.477
we're going to show you the
first way and that's to go into

bd33ad67-c5a5-4abc-8ad9-82b2c6782d3a-3
00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:12.110
the Map tab,

afe04adc-ca2e-440d-8d34-2bf75bd0b96d-0
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.320
then into the Layer section

605f3852-5b24-4c16-b173-3dc2cb8453d7-0
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.262
and now we can click on the Add
Data dropdown box and this is

605f3852-5b24-4c16-b173-3dc2cb8453d7-1
00:00:20.262 --> 00:00:23.564
going to give us a lot of
options for adding in data. We

605f3852-5b24-4c16-b173-3dc2cb8453d7-2
00:00:23.564 --> 00:00:27.214
just want to choose the first
option here which is add data to

605f3852-5b24-4c16-b173-3dc2cb8453d7-3
00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:27.620
the map

aae5704d-1dc5-4c0b-a005-9c5d5a7b90ab-0
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.477
and now we need to find the
folder where we saved our

aae5704d-1dc5-4c0b-a005-9c5d5a7b90ab-1
00:00:32.477 --> 00:00:36.112
materials and so here is intro
Arcgis Pro. So I'm going to

aae5704d-1dc5-4c0b-a005-9c5d5a7b90ab-2
00:00:36.112 --> 00:00:39.994
click on this and here are the
materials. And so if we go into

aae5704d-1dc5-4c0b-a005-9c5d5a7b90ab-3
00:00:39.994 --> 00:00:40.980
this folder here

26fe1c13-6540-49fb-ae01-10a12b95228e-0
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.927
we can see now all the data
layers that are within this

26fe1c13-6540-49fb-ae01-10a12b95228e-1
00:00:44.927 --> 00:00:45.260
folder

50fa8048-0ce8-4641-b438-dca77aceec3b-0
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.213
and we want to choose the Ziama
landscape shape file. So find

50fa8048-0ce8-4641-b438-dca77aceec3b-1
00:00:51.213 --> 00:00:51.940
this file

79e215a2-9c2a-485c-9804-2f5208baa1fa-0
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.920
and double click on it to load
it up.

567cbd14-a13e-43db-8007-13d3d0891e34-0
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.934
And now we've added in that data
layer. ArcGIS Pro has

567cbd14-a13e-43db-8007-13d3d0891e34-1
00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:08.535
automatically zoomed in on it
and so we can see the full

567cbd14-a13e-43db-8007-13d3d0891e34-2
00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:12.262
extent of that data layer and
that is the first method for

567cbd14-a13e-43db-8007-13d3d0891e34-3
00:01:12.262 --> 00:01:13.210
adding data in.
