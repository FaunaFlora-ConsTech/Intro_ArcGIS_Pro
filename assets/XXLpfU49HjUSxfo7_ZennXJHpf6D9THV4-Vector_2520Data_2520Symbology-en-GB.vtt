00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.491
Now we've looked at how to see
our data layer attributes and

59a88a99-8b15-4c80-a54f-611bc76bae92-1
00:00:07.491 --> 00:00:08.460
properties,

2eca8ba3-4573-4e7d-9eb7-cae71cd4d16c-0
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.620
and we've also hopefully changed
the names of our layers so

2eca8ba3-4573-4e7d-9eb7-cae71cd4d16c-1
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.821
they're nice and clear what
they're representing. We're

2eca8ba3-4573-4e7d-9eb7-cae71cd4d16c-2
00:00:15.821 --> 00:00:19.079
going to take a look at the
symbology of our vector data

2eca8ba3-4573-4e7d-9eb7-cae71cd4d16c-3
00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:19.480
layers.

5d9f9eda-3a95-4228-b129-9b1cb5dd85b9-0
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.768
So we're going to turn off our
two raster layers because we

5d9f9eda-3a95-4228-b129-9b1cb5dd85b9-1
00:00:25.768 --> 00:00:29.054
won't need them in this video
and just look at the three

5d9f9eda-3a95-4228-b129-9b1cb5dd85b9-2
00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:32.629
vector data layers that we have
at the top. So, we've got the

5d9f9eda-3a95-4228-b129-9b1cb5dd85b9-3
00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.376
biomonitoring points, the roads
and the polygon representing the

5d9f9eda-3a95-4228-b129-9b1cb5dd85b9-4
00:00:36.376 --> 00:00:39.719
Ziama protected area and we're
going to be looking at the

5d9f9eda-3a95-4228-b129-9b1cb5dd85b9-5
00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.890
symbology of this Ziama
protected area polygon in this

5d9f9eda-3a95-4228-b129-9b1cb5dd85b9-6
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.291
video. So at the moment we can
see that we've got a yellow

5d9f9eda-3a95-4228-b129-9b1cb5dd85b9-7
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:49.692
polygon to represent this, but
we're going to have a go at

5d9f9eda-3a95-4228-b129-9b1cb5dd85b9-8
00:00:49.692 --> 00:00:50.499
changing this.

4f840c21-e52a-4a7b-b246-0c0f75c63e7d-0
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.693
There's a couple ways to change
the symbology. For this method,

4f840c21-e52a-4a7b-b246-0c0f75c63e7d-1
00:00:56.693 --> 00:00:59.776
we're going to right click on
the layer and then choose

4f840c21-e52a-4a7b-b246-0c0f75c63e7d-2
00:00:59.776 --> 00:01:03.079
symbology and then this will
bring up the primary symbology

4f840c21-e52a-4a7b-b246-0c0f75c63e7d-3
00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.547
pane. So, within this pane we've
got an option here underneath

4f840c21-e52a-4a7b-b246-0c0f75c63e7d-4
00:01:06.547 --> 00:01:09.740
with the drop down box to choose
what we actually want to

4f840c21-e52a-4a7b-b246-0c0f75c63e7d-5
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.263
represent the data layer. And so
at the moment we have a single

4f840c21-e52a-4a7b-b246-0c0f75c63e7d-6
00:01:13.263 --> 00:01:16.787
symbol and actually this is the
best thing for representing the

4f840c21-e52a-4a7b-b246-0c0f75c63e7d-7
00:01:16.787 --> 00:01:19.760
protected area. So we're going
to keep this how it is

24b2ffe0-cf8b-48a7-8805-1a4c7f2991d8-0
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.311
and then to change what the
symbol looks like we can either

24b2ffe0-cf8b-48a7-8805-1a4c7f2991d8-1
00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:27.210
click on the box next to where
it says Symbol

ca857480-3a86-480b-add3-9e64cea56d73-0
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.786
and this will bring up the
Format Polygon symbol pane, or

ca857480-3a86-480b-add3-9e64cea56d73-1
00:01:33.786 --> 00:01:37.320
we can also click on the symbol
within our contents pane

ed01aeb5-4d7b-49f8-aa33-f3470faef00b-0
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.730
and that will bring up the same
pane.

80bf4bf2-9ea2-4d19-b1c9-1bd49b1b725e-0
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.516
And we're going to first of all
look at Gallery within this

80bf4bf2-9ea2-4d19-b1c9-1bd49b1b725e-1
00:01:47.516 --> 00:01:48.500
format polygon pane

e86f7009-b719-4a06-95d0-f1aa3819bbda-0
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.684
and within Gallery we have a lot
of pre-made symbols that we can

e86f7009-b719-4a06-95d0-f1aa3819bbda-1
00:01:53.684 --> 00:01:57.837
just click and choose. And so
we're going to choose the second

e86f7009-b719-4a06-95d0-f1aa3819bbda-2
00:01:57.837 --> 00:02:01.991
option here the black outline.
And if we click on this, we can

e86f7009-b719-4a06-95d0-f1aa3819bbda-3
00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:06.210
see that it changes the symbol
representing the protected area.

47117ea1-9e33-479c-a69a-8fa422bfb466-0
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.975
If we wanted to change this
further though, we could also go

47117ea1-9e33-479c-a69a-8fa422bfb466-1
00:02:10.975 --> 00:02:13.110
into the properties next to
Gallery

c40a708e-f233-41f4-a2f2-7bfeb61f6c60-0
00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.028
and in this section we can
choose exactly how we want our

c40a708e-f233-41f4-a2f2-7bfeb61f6c60-1
00:02:21.028 --> 00:02:24.834
symbol to look. So for example,
we can change the colour of the

c40a708e-f233-41f4-a2f2-7bfeb61f6c60-2
00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:25.310
polygon,

a010de10-1b2f-41ec-989a-c89572517387-0
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.599
we can change the outline
colour, and we can also change

a010de10-1b2f-41ec-989a-c89572517387-1
00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.342
the outline width, and we're
going to change this to 1

a010de10-1b2f-41ec-989a-c89572517387-2
00:02:34.342 --> 00:02:38.697
instead. And whenever you change
these, you need to remember to

a010de10-1b2f-41ec-989a-c89572517387-3
00:02:38.697 --> 00:02:41.759
click apply to actually apply
these changes.

ef130039-bb8c-4764-9484-de72a9531d2c-0
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.591
And here we go. We can see that
the outline of our symbol is now

ef130039-bb8c-4764-9484-de72a9531d2c-1
00:02:47.591 --> 00:02:50.617
a thinner black line, and so
that's how to change the

ef130039-bb8c-4764-9484-de72a9531d2c-2
00:02:50.617 --> 00:02:52.690
symbology of our vector data
layers.

38553c59-0a4a-4e98-82e6-80a924103b36-0
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.840
