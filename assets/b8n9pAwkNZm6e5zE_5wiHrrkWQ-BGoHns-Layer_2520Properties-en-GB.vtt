1e685b8a-9f22-40fb-a989-f97af48cf217-0
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.657
So now we know how to take a
look at the attributes of our

1e685b8a-9f22-40fb-a989-f97af48cf217-1
00:00:05.657 --> 00:00:09.668
data layers. Let's take a look
at the properties and to do this

1e685b8a-9f22-40fb-a989-f97af48cf217-2
00:00:09.668 --> 00:00:13.178
we're going to click on the
layer of our choosing, then

1e685b8a-9f22-40fb-a989-f97af48cf217-3
00:00:13.178 --> 00:00:15.560
right click and go down to
properties

b5c3dd62-afd1-454c-b1e6-328cc6507af9-0
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.616
and here it brings up this pop
up box with all the different

b5c3dd62-afd1-454c-b1e6-328cc6507af9-1
00:00:19.616 --> 00:00:22.855
properties that we can look at.
So we have all the tabs here on

b5c3dd62-afd1-454c-b1e6-328cc6507af9-2
00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:23.259
the left

71ed55d4-6191-4b4c-ab34-d1ff36855e6d-0
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.743
and looking in general to start
with, this is where you could

71ed55d4-6191-4b4c-ab34-d1ff36855e6d-1
00:00:27.743 --> 00:00:29.760
change the name of your data
layer.

e6bb46fc-a1b0-417f-bd28-bd7d26793cc1-0
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.440
You could also do this though by
shutting this box

6c49ed94-c07a-4406-a1ed-a0a62c0b6e6c-0
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.680
and then clicking once on a
selected data layer

64071a6e-5f36-420e-b621-b1b446624e26-0
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.110
and then you can change the name
in here. So we're going to name

64071a6e-5f36-420e-b621-b1b446624e26-1
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.270
this one Biomonitoring points.

2a05e770-7341-4133-a2ba-93b58d44d9fd-0
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.646
It's good practise to rename
your data layers to make them

2a05e770-7341-4133-a2ba-93b58d44d9fd-1
00:00:51.646 --> 00:00:53.970
easy to read and know what
you're working with.

398c9dd8-cbac-4591-9a22-05fe31106709-0
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.071
We'll go back into the
properties now by right clicking

398c9dd8-cbac-4591-9a22-05fe31106709-1
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:00.860
and going back down to
properties.

d145f15e-ddb4-45a5-be9b-becd34e2b96b-0
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.785
And now we'll take a look at the
metadata of this data layer by

d145f15e-ddb4-45a5-be9b-becd34e2b96b-1
00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:08.760
choosing the Metadata tab here.

9af1c47f-ad77-4668-9e7f-1da858c923d0-0
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.229
And if we scroll down, we can
see that this data layer doesn't

9af1c47f-ad77-4668-9e7f-1da858c923d0-1
00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.420
have any metadata yet.

46065b6f-3b81-481e-952e-b941febe19d1-0
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.600
If we wanted to add metadata
though, we can go into this box

46065b6f-3b81-481e-952e-b941febe19d1-1
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.473
at the top and click on the drop
down arrow. Now we can choose

46065b6f-3b81-481e-952e-b941febe19d1-2
00:01:24.473 --> 00:01:27.240
the top option 'layer has its
own metadata'.

af452a2e-bb64-4fee-a716-2f802a1b2567-0
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.300
It's really important to add
metadata to your data layers if

af452a2e-bb64-4fee-a716-2f802a1b2567-1
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.721
you're going to be sharing them.
This way, the person or people

af452a2e-bb64-4fee-a716-2f802a1b2567-2
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:40.089
that you share the data layer
with is going to be able to know

af452a2e-bb64-4fee-a716-2f802a1b2567-3
00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:43.456
what the data is representing.
So here we're going to add some

af452a2e-bb64-4fee-a716-2f802a1b2567-4
00:01:43.456 --> 00:01:46.877
metadata. We've added a title of
'Biomonitoring Points' and now

af452a2e-bb64-4fee-a716-2f802a1b2567-5
00:01:46.877 --> 00:01:49.390
we're going to add a summary of
our data layer

ae5492a8-d2b2-4cd8-a746-5c4697e4a99d-0
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.410
and we'll also add a
description.

67f00ae8-b3c7-46af-950f-1fbeccb45330-0
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.991
And then in credits we can write
in who has collected or created

67f00ae8-b3c7-46af-950f-1fbeccb45330-1
00:02:19.991 --> 00:02:21.130
the data layer.

ffe72812-258e-4514-9695-06ce9c86abd6-0
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.584
And in use limitations, we can
add any limitations that we have

ffe72812-258e-4514-9695-06ce9c86abd6-1
00:02:25.584 --> 00:02:29.211
in our data set. So for example,
we could write that this data

ffe72812-258e-4514-9695-06ce9c86abd6-2
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:32.896
was collected in the wet season
and so they don't represent the

ffe72812-258e-4514-9695-06ce9c86abd6-3
00:02:32.896 --> 00:02:33.530
dry season.

9635a1cd-45ec-4723-b6e3-6740cfdeb3af-0
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.722
So now if we were to send this
data layer to someone and they

9635a1cd-45ec-4723-b6e3-6740cfdeb3af-1
00:02:40.722 --> 00:02:43.308
don't know what the points
represent, they can go in and

9635a1cd-45ec-4723-b6e3-6740cfdeb3af-2
00:02:43.308 --> 00:02:45.350
check the metadata and get this
information.

8b35d941-b4ad-4495-b660-45a6b401962f-0
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.139
Another thing that we can look
out within our layer properties

8b35d941-b4ad-4495-b660-45a6b401962f-1
00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.866
is what coordinate system our
data layer was collected or

8b35d941-b4ad-4495-b660-45a6b401962f-2
00:02:56.866 --> 00:03:00.851
created in. To do this we want
to click on Source on the left

8b35d941-b4ad-4495-b660-45a6b401962f-3
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:01.430
hand side

40588535-3964-4485-9c05-63b1f8b91fe3-0
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.220
and then click on Spatial
Reference

19aa3fd8-c517-4746-82a9-946249136bc2-0
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.010
and here we can see that our
data was collected in the

19aa3fd8-c517-4746-82a9-946249136bc2-1
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.010
Geographic Coordinate system WGS
1984.

2d7d4355-aeb1-4189-ab28-4533ec4b4185-0
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.105
Knowing this information is
really important. As we can see

2d7d4355-aeb1-4189-ab28-4533ec4b4185-1
00:03:20.105 --> 00:03:23.190
this is in a geographic
coordinate system, and so if we

2d7d4355-aeb1-4189-ab28-4533ec4b4185-2
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.331
wanted to use it on our map
accurately and for analysis,

2d7d4355-aeb1-4189-ab28-4533ec4b4185-3
00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:28.700
then we'd need to project this
data layer.

26802a96-275d-47e9-a6fe-c608e73ad13e-0
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.300
And so that's how to look at the
properties of the layers and

26802a96-275d-47e9-a6fe-c608e73ad13e-1
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.947
some of the useful things that
you can look at within the

26802a96-275d-47e9-a6fe-c608e73ad13e-2
00:03:37.947 --> 00:03:38.450
properties.
