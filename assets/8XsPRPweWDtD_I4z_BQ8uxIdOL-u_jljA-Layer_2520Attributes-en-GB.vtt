00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.080
Now we have our data in our
project. We're just going to

567299e0-93bf-4675-97ec-f1be36dd252c-1
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.391
turn off the two basemaps
because we don't need them and

567299e0-93bf-4675-97ec-f1be36dd252c-2
00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:09.960
they can slow us down a bit

1a371ba4-bdd3-4d7b-a740-ba0f2f81517d-0
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.028
and we can see our layers here.
We can use the arrow next to the

1a371ba4-bdd3-4d7b-a740-ba0f2f81517d-1
00:00:15.028 --> 00:00:18.704
layers to either see the
symbology or close it. Sometimes

1a371ba4-bdd3-4d7b-a740-ba0f2f81517d-2
00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:22.443
it's good to close it just so we
can see all of the layers

1a371ba4-bdd3-4d7b-a740-ba0f2f81517d-3
00:00:22.443 --> 00:00:22.950
clearly.

32be4360-a17d-47e2-b19c-f39c6494495a-0
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.727
And now we're going to take a
look at the first layer, which

32be4360-a17d-47e2-b19c-f39c6494495a-1
00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:31.708
is the biomonitoring points. So
this is a vector point data

32be4360-a17d-47e2-b19c-f39c6494495a-2
00:00:31.708 --> 00:00:32.040
layer

10e3c5cc-75c2-480f-b1a8-3993550c130e-0
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.294
and then looking at the roads
and tracks, these are vector

10e3c5cc-75c2-480f-b1a8-3993550c130e-1
00:00:38.294 --> 00:00:38.950
line data

30f229c7-50b6-4661-9b9d-afcdc82e0896-0
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.157
and then the Ziama landscape is
a vector polygon. And then we

30f229c7-50b6-4661-9b9d-afcdc82e0896-1
00:00:44.157 --> 00:00:47.765
have the two rasters at the
bottom, the landcover and the

30f229c7-50b6-4661-9b9d-afcdc82e0896-2
00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:51.498
DEM. And we're going to go over
those a bit more in another

30f229c7-50b6-4661-9b9d-afcdc82e0896-3
00:00:51.498 --> 00:00:51.810
video

eae066a2-0cce-46c6-a989-8ee20e08343b-0
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.597
and we're going to be going over
how to look at the attributes of

eae066a2-0cce-46c6-a989-8ee20e08343b-1
00:00:57.597 --> 00:00:58.920
our different layers.

c77a24cb-e2f7-4320-b6e5-f16efee02440-0
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.263
So looking at the Biomonitoring
layer, we can right click on

c77a24cb-e2f7-4320-b6e5-f16efee02440-1
00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:04.990
this layer

6291ae7f-9d50-427c-9b55-24c42a548c92-0
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.790
and then click Attribute table

5c872916-814c-4da2-8f05-d263448ed7b2-0
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.103
and this is going to open up our
attributes which are the

5c872916-814c-4da2-8f05-d263448ed7b2-1
00:01:17.103 --> 00:01:20.406
information attached to our data
layers. And so this is the

5c872916-814c-4da2-8f05-d263448ed7b2-2
00:01:20.406 --> 00:01:23.380
information attached to the
biomonitoring data layer.

19d11371-d90b-4f73-b324-ca994c25a745-0
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.528
And in this table, we can see
that we've got a row for each

19d11371-d90b-4f73-b324-ca994c25a745-1
00:01:30.528 --> 00:01:30.910
point,

a4731d55-ce85-42c7-81cf-7c816b0f50d5-0
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.470
and the points are representing
a location of a species.

3077a31c-5aba-4b20-8b88-304b39d540ae-0
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.408
And so the information that we
have is we've got the date that

3077a31c-5aba-4b20-8b88-304b39d540ae-1
00:01:42.408 --> 00:01:46.792
the sighting was located, we've
got the location in latitude and

3077a31c-5aba-4b20-8b88-304b39d540ae-2
00:01:46.792 --> 00:01:50.838
longitude, and this is what's
allowing the data point to be

3077a31c-5aba-4b20-8b88-304b39d540ae-3
00:01:50.838 --> 00:01:54.480
put on the map. We've got the
species that were cited

0446d490-7dd6-4c0a-8d05-e0b59042e6e5-0
00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.020
and then we've got the indicator
of the sighting as well.

62b2963c-5e9c-4bed-acd5-80153ebea6bc-0
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.683
What we can do with this
attribute table is we can use it

62b2963c-5e9c-4bed-acd5-80153ebea6bc-1
00:02:06.683 --> 00:02:10.900
to select the data that we want
and then see it upon our map. To

62b2963c-5e9c-4bed-acd5-80153ebea6bc-2
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.052
do this we just need to click on
the row number on the left and

62b2963c-5e9c-4bed-acd5-80153ebea6bc-3
00:02:15.052 --> 00:02:19.075
then this is going to select
this point or this row and so we

62b2963c-5e9c-4bed-acd5-80153ebea6bc-4
00:02:19.075 --> 00:02:21.800
can see the highlighted point on
our map.

38d564a1-8f6d-4024-a636-fbf1cf6f9752-0
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.092
We could also hold the click
button and drag up or down to

38d564a1-8f6d-4024-a636-fbf1cf6f9752-1
00:02:26.092 --> 00:02:28.020
select multiple adjacent points.

3aab4aba-9a49-4951-aaeb-6a26c3519cc8-0
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.551
Or we can use the control button
to select multiple unadjacent

3aab4aba-9a49-4951-aaeb-6a26c3519cc8-1
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:35.811
points just by clicking on a row
holding control and then

3aab4aba-9a49-4951-aaeb-6a26c3519cc8-2
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:38.510
clicking the other rows that we
want to select.

397efb13-1228-4827-9729-6f829a1aec24-0
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.995
If we want to clear our
selection, we can click on the

397efb13-1228-4827-9729-6f829a1aec24-1
00:02:52.995 --> 00:02:54.100
clear button here,

2bc2de55-d744-4e9b-8a8e-0182d0dd27af-0
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.150
or we can also click on the
white corner of the table

ed60e8bb-bbd5-4d99-8976-9980bbff159f-0
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.430
and so that's how to view our
attributes of our data layers.
