00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.573
In this video we're going to add
a legend onto our layout and so

d04027fb-fa15-4f2d-ab69-e9987d5ad831-1
00:00:04.573 --> 00:00:08.325
to do that make sure you're in
the Insert tab and we're going

d04027fb-fa15-4f2d-ab69-e9987d5ad831-2
00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:12.016
to go into the map surrounds
section and click on the Legend

d04027fb-fa15-4f2d-ab69-e9987d5ad831-3
00:00:12.016 --> 00:00:12.440
button.

07a35be1-4c4e-403a-982e-d3d3e701bdbc-0
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.946
Now we have the drawing tool to
be able to draw our legend onto

07a35be1-4c4e-403a-982e-d3d3e701bdbc-1
00:00:16.946 --> 00:00:20.200
our layout and so go ahead and
draw it onto your page.

df855de6-0854-479b-88bd-83aa08da7a28-0
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.666
And now Arcgis Pro has
automatically added the elements

df855de6-0854-479b-88bd-83aa08da7a28-1
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:30.878
we have on our map into our
legend, so we can see our bio

df855de6-0854-479b-88bd-83aa08da7a28-2
00:00:30.878 --> 00:00:35.308
monitoring points, we can see
the roads, the Ziama protected

df855de6-0854-479b-88bd-83aa08da7a28-3
00:00:35.308 --> 00:00:37.559
area, and our land cover types.

fc7091b8-22ac-48c5-907e-3eafcb477ffd-0
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.558
So now just spend some time just
to resize your legend to get it

fc7091b8-22ac-48c5-907e-3eafcb477ffd-1
00:00:42.558 --> 00:00:43.680
to how you want.

fe235faa-d5fa-403e-b25a-093c2f98c74e-0
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.431
And now we're going to take a
look at how to change our legend

fe235faa-d5fa-403e-b25a-093c2f98c74e-1
00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:53.960
to get it to exactly our
preferences.

3aca33ff-1c6b-4432-982b-c2946b2155bb-0
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.853
And so to do that, you need to
go into your contents pane and

3aca33ff-1c6b-4432-982b-c2946b2155bb-1
00:00:57.853 --> 00:01:01.418
we can see our legend underneath
the Layout tab in our contents

3aca33ff-1c6b-4432-982b-c2946b2155bb-2
00:01:01.418 --> 00:01:01.919
pane now.

2381acef-617a-4f5b-bc4f-ea085f165bff-0
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.648
So you can see the different
elements within the legend

2381acef-617a-4f5b-bc4f-ea085f165bff-1
00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:06.240
underneath.

26dd068b-558a-4069-96ea-0ffaaa3bbec7-0
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.720
And you can toggle these on and
off here.

abc5be19-1976-42a8-bb31-e855b1b320fa-0
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.520
But let's take a look at our
legend properties.

bf5576a6-8be9-46af-8b2b-ce28a5ed5aa9-0
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.189
So we're going to right click on
where it says Legend and go to

bf5576a6-8be9-46af-8b2b-ce28a5ed5aa9-1
00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:15.800
properties.

4056e6d5-e381-4f9e-8f1b-df8525c0b8c1-0
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.191
And this is going to bring up
this element pane here, where we

4056e6d5-e381-4f9e-8f1b-df8525c0b8c1-1
00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:21.320
can change the properties of our
legend.

a16e4bef-b238-4195-bef2-b9cf76ff0f2a-0
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.817
So there's different tabs along
the top, and within the first

a16e4bef-b238-4195-bef2-b9cf76ff0f2a-1
00:01:26.817 --> 00:01:32.031
tab that we're in, we've got the
Legend section here where we can

a16e4bef-b238-4195-bef2-b9cf76ff0f2a-2
00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:34.480
change the title of our legend.

0da7c634-92b6-48bf-9937-8220d6c482c5-0
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.400
So let's name it Biomonitoring
(Ziama; 2019).

1df422e2-94dc-4eee-8a26-3ecb99f4668a-0
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.900
And now we can see that's
changed the title of our legend.

e965a542-3a25-4d8a-9515-4bc1fa072318-0
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.904
So now we'll take a look at one
of the other tabs within the

e965a542-3a25-4d8a-9515-4bc1fa072318-1
00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:54.540
element pane, the Display tab.

e54eb750-cabe-4ade-b050-e11225770ff8-0
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.631
And this is where we can change
what the actual legend box looks

e54eb750-cabe-4ade-b050-e11225770ff8-1
00:01:58.631 --> 00:01:58.900
like.

5a7eb04c-915a-4b94-ad1f-2e2fcc0c1f56-0
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.620
So let's put a border on it.

4031a27d-842d-4b6a-b08a-03a267dc64a0-0
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.108
We'll put a black border going
around it, and now you can see

4031a27d-842d-4b6a-b08a-03a267dc64a0-1
00:02:06.108 --> 00:02:08.880
that's updated on our layout
page.

f987c805-8503-48cb-a9ce-a97747627840-0
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.318
So now we've seen how to change
the properties of our legend box

f987c805-8503-48cb-a9ce-a97747627840-1
00:02:14.318 --> 00:02:17.407
by right clicking on Legend in
our contents, choosing

f987c805-8503-48cb-a9ce-a97747627840-2
00:02:17.407 --> 00:02:21.067
Properties, and then it brings
up the element pane on the right

f987c805-8503-48cb-a9ce-a97747627840-3
00:02:21.067 --> 00:02:21.639
hand side.

a0789070-6e39-4249-9e9b-72b1396752e4-0
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.874
We can also do that for any of
the specific elements within our

a0789070-6e39-4249-9e9b-72b1396752e4-1
00:02:25.874 --> 00:02:29.360
contents, because we've got the
element pane already up.

8ffee889-8e62-4f40-9e3a-0b7e0027c336-0
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.380
All we need to do is click on
the elements within the contents

8ffee889-8e62-4f40-9e3a-0b7e0027c336-1
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.824
and it brings up the properties
for each thing within our

8ffee889-8e62-4f40-9e3a-0b7e0027c336-2
00:02:36.824 --> 00:02:37.240
legend.

6a03b8d8-0b93-4b39-8cd3-749de46ec546-0
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.818
And so there's lots of options
for getting your legend and the

6a03b8d8-0b93-4b39-8cd3-749de46ec546-1
00:02:41.818 --> 00:02:45.205
legend items exactly how you
