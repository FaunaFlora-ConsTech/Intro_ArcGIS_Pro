0ac0af6e-3a7b-49e9-8b68-448e9eba457d-0
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.860
Now we've opened up our first
project within Arcgis Pro. We're

0ac0af6e-3a7b-49e9-8b68-448e9eba457d-1
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.030
going to go over the layout of
Arcgis Pro and what some of the

0ac0af6e-3a7b-49e9-8b68-448e9eba457d-2
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.089
main buttons do.

197ead6f-89a0-4e5a-96ba-09ba3d566890-0
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.538
We'll start off by taking a look
at the ribbon at the top here.

197ead6f-89a0-4e5a-96ba-09ba3d566890-1
00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:21.667
So this is where you can access
the main buttons. We've got the

197ead6f-89a0-4e5a-96ba-09ba3d566890-2
00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:25.861
different tabs which change the
buttons that you can have access

197ead6f-89a0-4e5a-96ba-09ba3d566890-3
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:30.119
to, and then within the very top
left corner, this is where we've

197ead6f-89a0-4e5a-96ba-09ba3d566890-4
00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.376
got quick buttons for creating a
new project, opening an existing

197ead6f-89a0-4e5a-96ba-09ba3d566890-5
00:00:34.376 --> 00:00:38.441
project or saving your project.
And also we have undo and redo

197ead6f-89a0-4e5a-96ba-09ba3d566890-6
00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:39.279
buttons here.

90f1cf54-440e-4fc6-a4df-f57456552c12-0
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.910
So we're first of all going to
take a look at the Project

90f1cf54-440e-4fc6-a4df-f57456552c12-1
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.310
button. So project works very
similar to file within Microsoft

90f1cf54-440e-4fc6-a4df-f57456552c12-2
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.640
programmes. So within Project we
could open a new project. So

90f1cf54-440e-4fc6-a4df-f57456552c12-3
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.760
we've got the buttons here for
starting with a template or

90f1cf54-440e-4fc6-a4df-f57456552c12-4
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.810
without. We also can open an
existing project and we have

90f1cf54-440e-4fc6-a4df-f57456552c12-5
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.001
save and save as here. There's
some other buttons here with

90f1cf54-440e-4fc6-a4df-f57456552c12-6
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:12.330
some more information or for
example options, which allows us

90f1cf54-440e-4fc6-a4df-f57456552c12-7
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.750
to set

da0a301c-d4de-41e0-81a7-1488707c4008-0
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.081
certain preferences for how
we're using the software. And

da0a301c-d4de-41e0-81a7-1488707c4008-1
00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:21.040
within help you can access the
Esri online help page.

eeca974b-17b3-4a96-836e-de3b0c891b74-0
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.765
So now we'll take a look at the
Map tab. So going from left to

eeca974b-17b3-4a96-836e-de3b0c891b74-1
00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:37.171
right we have Clipboard. This is
where you can access the copy

eeca974b-17b3-4a96-836e-de3b0c891b74-2
00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:38.500
and paste functions

b475e3bf-f086-4bcd-a230-36519e67c483-0
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.202
and next we have navigate. So
hopefully at this point you've

b475e3bf-f086-4bcd-a230-36519e67c483-1
00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:47.119
had some time to have a go at
navigating around your map in

b475e3bf-f086-4bcd-a230-36519e67c483-2
00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.101
your project. You can use the
scroller to zoom in and out on

b475e3bf-f086-4bcd-a230-36519e67c483-3
00:01:51.101 --> 00:01:55.280
your mouse, and the left button
to drag yourself around the map

5b6af37e-e84c-4528-ab0b-822c206174d5-0
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.209
within the navigate bar. We've
also got some fixed zoom in and

5b6af37e-e84c-4528-ab0b-822c206174d5-1
00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:02.550
zoom out buttons,

abd91a53-a4dd-40c2-8a64-1ebfdb9c7215-0
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.558
and the little globe button to
the top of these allows us to

abd91a53-a4dd-40c2-8a64-1ebfdb9c7215-1
00:02:08.558 --> 00:02:10.830
zoom to the full extent of our
map.

9d818772-20d9-4617-aee9-2eea2b34f084-0
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.883
We also have backwards and
forwards arrows, and these allow

9d818772-20d9-4617-aee9-2eea2b34f084-1
00:02:17.883 --> 00:02:21.749
us to go to the previous extent
that we had zoomed in on our

9d818772-20d9-4617-aee9-2eea2b34f084-2
00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:25.489
map. So we can go back and
forwards within these different

9d818772-20d9-4617-aee9-2eea2b34f084-3
00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:25.870
views.

74eb3ea4-3269-47be-ab84-b03886996551-0
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.969
And then bookmarks is a really
useful tool for if you want to

74eb3ea4-3269-47be-ab84-b03886996551-1
00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.813
save a particular view within
your map. That's useful, for

74eb3ea4-3269-47be-ab84-b03886996551-2
00:02:34.813 --> 00:02:37.680
example to have Spain centered
in your map.

c38dd60f-5bf9-4fe8-a222-6003996b82f5-0
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.616
Then you can create a bookmark
of this view by going into

c38dd60f-5bf9-4fe8-a222-6003996b82f5-1
00:02:42.616 --> 00:02:46.632
bookmarks, clicking New
Bookmark. Then you can name what

c38dd60f-5bf9-4fe8-a222-6003996b82f5-2
00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:47.760
your view is on.

ab66222c-5e47-4141-a539-422f64c7aaec-0
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.913
And this means that if you ended
up in a different place on your

ab66222c-5e47-4141-a539-422f64c7aaec-1
00:02:52.913 --> 00:02:56.240
map and you wanted to access
this view again, you just need

ab66222c-5e47-4141-a539-422f64c7aaec-2
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.677
to click on Bookmarks and click
on that the bookmark that you

ab66222c-5e47-4141-a539-422f64c7aaec-3
00:02:59.677 --> 00:03:01.840
saved and you'll have your view
again.

b7d6e3c1-9504-4121-b561-92b11cc305cd-0
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.725
So at this point I'd really
recommend pausing the video and

b7d6e3c1-9504-4121-b561-92b11cc305cd-1
00:03:07.725 --> 00:03:10.040
having a go yourself at creating
a bookmark.

0cf1eeb7-6625-4207-bbe1-823df4705487-0
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.185
Now going along, we also have Go
to XY button and this just

0cf1eeb7-6625-4207-bbe1-823df4705487-1
00:03:16.185 --> 00:03:20.271
allows us to input specific
coordinates and it will take us

0cf1eeb7-6625-4207-bbe1-823df4705487-2
00:03:20.271 --> 00:03:24.697
to that location. Now we'll take
a look at layer within layer we

0cf1eeb7-6625-4207-bbe1-823df4705487-3
00:03:24.697 --> 00:03:29.055
can change our basemap. So for
the moment we've got the basemap

0cf1eeb7-6625-4207-bbe1-823df4705487-4
00:03:29.055 --> 00:03:33.209
that was automatically opened
with when we set our template,

0cf1eeb7-6625-4207-bbe1-823df4705487-5
00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.567
but we can change this. So for
example, we can change it to the

0cf1eeb7-6625-4207-bbe1-823df4705487-6
00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:41.720
imagery base map here by going
in the basemap tab, but we'll

0cf1eeb7-6625-4207-bbe1-823df4705487-7
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.470
change this

21f2f652-c0b4-4800-af17-ced022432544-0
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.060
back to the one we just had.

9989a477-bf29-412a-a423-f38f5733c585-0
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.393
And within layer we can also add
our data in. So we've got lots

9989a477-bf29-412a-a423-f38f5733c585-1
00:03:52.393 --> 00:03:54.270
of options for adding data in.

4905919f-9996-40ca-9298-65479bef92cd-0
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.131
And then we have the select
tool. So once we have some data

4905919f-9996-40ca-9298-65479bef92cd-1
00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:04.871
within our map, this is going to
allow us to select it. And we

4905919f-9996-40ca-9298-65479bef92cd-2
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:08.373
have lots of different options
for selecting our data, for

4905919f-9996-40ca-9298-65479bef92cd-3
00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:10.569
example by attribute or by
location.

182c807e-9c0c-41e5-8ff9-539b96b5e7cf-0
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.730
So we've got some other useful
tools here as well. So for

182c807e-9c0c-41e5-8ff9-539b96b5e7cf-1
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.837
example, measure where we can
measure certain distances on our

182c807e-9c0c-41e5-8ff9-539b96b5e7cf-2
00:04:20.837 --> 00:04:25.009
map and locate where we can do a
search of cities, countries or

182c807e-9c0c-41e5-8ff9-539b96b5e7cf-3
00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.985
towns for example, within our
map or map layers. We also can

182c807e-9c0c-41e5-8ff9-539b96b5e7cf-4
00:04:28.985 --> 00:04:32.310
manage our label properties
within labelling here,

f0c8e16a-a523-4902-b67f-b0d94aa6c0e8-0
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.850
and within the Offline section
of this tab we could download

f0c8e16a-a523-4902-b67f-b0d94aa6c0e8-1
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.570
our map to enable offline use

4ac128eb-5a5b-488c-afe9-d625118d327d-0
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.936
and next we'll take a look at
the Insert tab. So within insert

4ac128eb-5a5b-488c-afe9-d625118d327d-1
00:04:50.936 --> 00:04:55.531
we can add a new map to our
project if we wanted to, and the

4ac128eb-5a5b-488c-afe9-d625118d327d-2
00:04:55.531 --> 00:05:00.126
button next to this New Layout
allows us to add a layout and

4ac128eb-5a5b-488c-afe9-d625118d327d-3
00:05:00.126 --> 00:05:04.269
we'll be going over how to do
this within this course.

d58c24fb-d435-4244-9797-03e4d83c4f59-0
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.370
Within this section we also have
the buttons here, Import Map and

d58c24fb-d435-4244-9797-03e4d83c4f59-1
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.848
Layout and this is for importing
specifically an MXD file,

d58c24fb-d435-4244-9797-03e4d83c4f59-2
00:05:12.848 --> 00:05:16.267
otherwise known as an ArcMap
desktop document. So, if you

d58c24fb-d435-4244-9797-03e4d83c4f59-3
00:05:16.267 --> 00:05:20.040
have these files and you want to
import them, this is where you

d58c24fb-d435-4244-9797-03e4d83c4f59-4
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.630
should go.

d9c709dc-1935-4537-8724-797e1b21ee79-0
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.655
And then we've got a connections
button here which allows us to

d9c709dc-1935-4537-8724-797e1b21ee79-1
00:05:25.655 --> 00:05:29.448
connect to a geodatabase or an
online server and we also have

d9c709dc-1935-4537-8724-797e1b21ee79-2
00:05:29.448 --> 00:05:33.180
the Add folder which allows us
to create folder connections.

37864d2d-7d17-44af-a6d7-4a0af2397186-0
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.936
And then we have layer templates
here which are blank point, line

37864d2d-7d17-44af-a6d7-4a0af2397186-1
00:05:39.936 --> 00:05:43.200
and polygon templates that we
can use and edit.

78bc66df-fad4-417c-9757-ead8216752b8-0
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.185
And we also have the style
section here where we can add,

78bc66df-fad4-417c-9757-ead8216752b8-1
00:05:49.185 --> 00:05:53.787
create or import style files
which just allow us to have more

78bc66df-fad4-417c-9757-ead8216752b8-2
00:05:53.787 --> 00:05:56.460
custom colours within our
projects.

79264072-4a58-4991-84ea-2ce8abd11196-0
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.238
And now we'll take a look at the
Analysis tab. So this is where

79264072-4a58-4991-84ea-2ce8abd11196-1
00:06:04.238 --> 00:06:09.177
we're going to analyse our data
and where we can access all the

79264072-4a58-4991-84ea-2ce8abd11196-2
00:06:09.177 --> 00:06:14.193
geoprocessing tools that we need
for our projects. So within the

79264072-4a58-4991-84ea-2ce8abd11196-3
00:06:14.193 --> 00:06:18.900
Geoprocessing section here, we
can access our toolbox of all

79264072-4a58-4991-84ea-2ce8abd11196-4
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.376
the different geoprocessing
tools. There is also a button

79264072-4a58-4991-84ea-2ce8abd11196-5
00:06:23.376 --> 00:06:28.006
for the history and this is
where we can see the tools that

79264072-4a58-4991-84ea-2ce8abd11196-6
00:06:28.006 --> 00:06:29.549
we've used recently.

e1565406-9506-46a3-928c-241dbcd564d4-0
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.969
We also have a button here for
opening up a Python window for

e1565406-9506-46a3-928c-241dbcd564d4-1
00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:42.369
running script and also model
builder which is an interactive

e1565406-9506-46a3-928c-241dbcd564d4-2
00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:45.940
portal allowing us to build
custom tools

2a5e4c58-3816-447c-896d-48b6810d3e7c-0
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.901
and then within this tool
section here. This is just

2a5e4c58-3816-447c-896d-48b6810d3e7c-1
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:58.850
allowing us easy access to some
vector data analysis tools.

edbf3851-6951-4818-b634-df31d4e220cb-0
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.627
We also have a lot of other
buttons here which I'm not going

edbf3851-6951-4818-b634-df31d4e220cb-1
00:07:02.627 --> 00:07:05.898
to go over right now, but if you
do want to find out more about

edbf3851-6951-4818-b634-df31d4e220cb-2
00:07:05.898 --> 00:07:09.015
them you can hover your mouse
over them and it will give you

edbf3851-6951-4818-b634-df31d4e220cb-3
00:07:09.015 --> 00:07:10.139
some more information.

5e29924a-bf5a-4de9-8128-c5d2fedbbf3a-0
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:16.361
These raster buttons here in the
corner. The raster functions

5e29924a-bf5a-4de9-8128-c5d2fedbbf3a-1
00:07:16.361 --> 00:07:20.941
allows you to bring up the
raster function pane and then

5e29924a-bf5a-4de9-8128-c5d2fedbbf3a-2
00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:25.280
function editor allows you to
create custom functions

320f9cba-ab41-4979-92e4-533af69bb0a0-0
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.177
and now we'll take a look at the
view tab. So first of all, just

320f9cba-ab41-4979-92e4-533af69bb0a0-1
00:07:31.177 --> 00:07:35.075
to go over some of the buttons
that we've got in the top left

320f9cba-ab41-4979-92e4-533af69bb0a0-2
00:07:35.075 --> 00:07:38.596
here. Within view we have
convert and this converts our

320f9cba-ab41-4979-92e4-533af69bb0a0-3
00:07:38.596 --> 00:07:39.980
map frame to a 3D map.

d3a773ac-ad17-42dd-8940-2dd927d0c0bb-0
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:45.265
Within Link we have link views
and this allows us to link our

d3a773ac-ad17-42dd-8940-2dd927d0c0bb-1
00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:49.141
two map frames to the same
extent or zoom levels for

d3a773ac-ad17-42dd-8940-2dd927d0c0bb-2
00:07:49.141 --> 00:07:49.800
analysis.

afa6f7dd-f347-4cf4-b294-6b75654e6d47-0
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.895
But the View tab is mainly about
deciding how we want the layout

afa6f7dd-f347-4cf4-b294-6b75654e6d47-1
00:07:54.895 --> 00:07:58.301
of our actual screen to look and
where we can access the

afa6f7dd-f347-4cf4-b294-6b75654e6d47-2
00:07:58.301 --> 00:08:02.007
different buttons and windows.
So within this Windows section

afa6f7dd-f347-4cf4-b294-6b75654e6d47-3
00:08:02.007 --> 00:08:05.474
here, this is where we can
access all of the windows that

afa6f7dd-f347-4cf4-b294-6b75654e6d47-4
00:08:05.474 --> 00:08:09.299
we have up. So for example, we
could shut the contents pane and

afa6f7dd-f347-4cf4-b294-6b75654e6d47-5
00:08:09.299 --> 00:08:13.064
within Windows we can now open
this back up. So this is really

afa6f7dd-f347-4cf4-b294-6b75654e6d47-6
00:08:13.064 --> 00:08:16.710
useful if you ever lose any of
your panes and you don't know

afa6f7dd-f347-4cf4-b294-6b75654e6d47-7
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:20.237
where they've gone. This is the
best place to access them.

afa6f7dd-f347-4cf4-b294-6b75654e6d47-8
00:08:20.237 --> 00:08:22.090
Within view you can also create

b37af7ef-5ced-4628-9880-c2283af84e8c-0
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.710
an animation as well.

f6c8c6b4-01c7-4a6f-a60d-cc09ce20a1d9-0
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.111
And now we'll take a look at the
Edit tab. And so this is the

f6c8c6b4-01c7-4a6f-a60d-cc09ce20a1d9-1
00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:33.758
section where we have the
buttons for creating and editing

f6c8c6b4-01c7-4a6f-a60d-cc09ce20a1d9-2
00:08:33.758 --> 00:08:34.500
vector data.

a48042e1-c102-4dbf-936e-7d3f4b938b72-0
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.941
So to start with we have
clipboard and so we can copy and

a48042e1-c102-4dbf-936e-7d3f4b938b72-1
00:08:38.941 --> 00:08:43.004
paste data using this. And then
in Manage Edits we've got the

a48042e1-c102-4dbf-936e-7d3f4b938b72-2
00:08:43.004 --> 00:08:47.330
really important Save button for
saving any edits that we make to

a48042e1-c102-4dbf-936e-7d3f4b938b72-3
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:47.920
our data.

82b7e672-088c-409d-bb95-47f3190cd96c-0
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.180
We also have Discard if we
wanted to get rid of any of

82b7e672-088c-409d-bb95-47f3190cd96c-1
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:52.970
these edits.

f15d1fe5-cc91-467f-9a47-578571f75033-0
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:58.015
We've got the snapping button
here which allows us to turn

f15d1fe5-cc91-467f-9a47-578571f75033-1
00:08:58.015 --> 00:09:01.964
snapping on or off, which we'll
just place or align our features

f15d1fe5-cc91-467f-9a47-578571f75033-2
00:09:01.964 --> 00:09:03.180
with other features.

0991d742-12ca-4d2e-9c7c-dbe180e47ab3-0
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.520
And then we have the Create and
Modify and delete buttons here.

0991d742-12ca-4d2e-9c7c-dbe180e47ab3-1
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.043
So this is for adding,
modifying, and deleting our

0991d742-12ca-4d2e-9c7c-dbe180e47ab3-2
00:09:13.043 --> 00:09:14.009
vector layers.

2186c014-cced-47e6-97da-edda5d47f1bb-0
00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.580
We've got another selection pane
here for selecting our data

6d846bbd-0649-4bad-ba72-69b13c01e2bd-0
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.672
and then these are our tools
here for editing our vector

6d846bbd-0649-4bad-ba72-69b13c01e2bd-1
00:09:25.672 --> 00:09:29.723
data. So for example, the move
tool we could use to move a

6d846bbd-0649-4bad-ba72-69b13c01e2bd-2
00:09:29.723 --> 00:09:33.979
Polygon, and then we've got a
reshape tool here as well where

6d846bbd-0649-4bad-ba72-69b13c01e2bd-3
00:09:33.979 --> 00:09:35.970
we could reshape our Polygon.

c36cf57b-34f7-4ec5-aaf6-79e5537dcb46-0
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.850
And now we'll take a look at the
imagery tab.

9ce8e07f-a00f-4a3b-a669-d09402275ab6-0
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.951
And we're not going to talk too
much about this, but this is the

9ce8e07f-a00f-4a3b-a669-d09402275ab6-1
00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:48.931
section that you would use if
you're working with aerial or

9ce8e07f-a00f-4a3b-a669-d09402275ab6-2
00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:53.044
satellite imagery. And so you
can use the buttons within this

9ce8e07f-a00f-4a3b-a669-d09402275ab6-3
00:09:53.044 --> 00:09:56.560
section to load in or analyse
this data for example.

3cbdfb0b-f16a-4507-832d-f21296db5354-0
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.179
And the last tab within this
ribbon is Share. So this is

3cbdfb0b-f16a-4507-832d-f21296db5354-1
00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:07.591
where we can package, upload and
export our Arcgis Pro project.

3cbdfb0b-f16a-4507-832d-f21296db5354-2
00:10:07.591 --> 00:10:12.003
So for example, within package
here we can package up our whole

3cbdfb0b-f16a-4507-832d-f21296db5354-3
00:10:12.003 --> 00:10:16.345
project to allow us to send it
to someone. Or we could package

3cbdfb0b-f16a-4507-832d-f21296db5354-4
00:10:16.345 --> 00:10:17.380
up just our map

73420d33-3363-460d-8667-5c2adac05f97-0
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:22.746
and then the button here which
says geoprocessing. This allows

73420d33-3363-460d-8667-5c2adac05f97-1
00:10:22.746 --> 00:10:26.971
us to package up a geoprocessing
tool to let others use it.

73420d33-3363-460d-8667-5c2adac05f97-2
00:10:26.971 --> 00:10:31.267
Within Share As, we can share
our data as an interactive web

73420d33-3363-460d-8667-5c2adac05f97-3
00:10:31.267 --> 00:10:33.379
map or web layer to Arc Online

5e2c53ac-c147-4f21-bead-ef3df89e5f1f-0
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:40.600
and then within Save As we can
create a project template here.

8ce07cf4-0d5e-47d6-9316-13d56f2c3859-0
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:46.292
Output, this is the really
important section. So this is

8ce07cf4-0d5e-47d6-9316-13d56f2c3859-1
00:10:46.292 --> 00:10:50.690
where we can print or export our
map to a range of locations.

56cde1d5-3f83-48e4-bd45-c220403d2245-0
00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:55.498
And now we'll take a look at the
other windows that we can see

56cde1d5-3f83-48e4-bd45-c220403d2245-1
00:10:55.498 --> 00:10:59.291
within Arcgis Pro. So on the
left here, you'll probably have

56cde1d5-3f83-48e4-bd45-c220403d2245-2
00:10:59.291 --> 00:11:03.272
your contents window up and this
is where we can see all of the

56cde1d5-3f83-48e4-bd45-c220403d2245-3
00:11:03.272 --> 00:11:05.760
data layers that we put within
our map,

19e81624-47c1-4322-9f69-fb21a392e71a-0
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:10.581
So within catalog, we can see
all the items that we have

19e81624-47c1-4322-9f69-fb21a392e71a-1
00:11:10.581 --> 00:11:14.923
within our Arcgis Pro project.
For example within maps we can

19e81624-47c1-4322-9f69-fb21a392e71a-2
00:11:14.923 --> 00:11:19.406
see the map that we have within
our project and we can also see

19e81624-47c1-4322-9f69-fb21a392e71a-3
00:11:19.406 --> 00:11:23.958
our connections. So for example
to our Geodatabase or our folder

19e81624-47c1-4322-9f69-fb21a392e71a-4
00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:27.740
connections and our styles we
can store here as well.

0e11d3c8-848e-4b2f-91fb-b880100c436b-0
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:33.621
In Portal, we can access all of
our portals and these are online

0e11d3c8-848e-4b2f-91fb-b880100c436b-1
00:11:33.621 --> 00:11:37.934
locations where GIS data is
stored and shared. So we might

0e11d3c8-848e-4b2f-91fb-b880100c436b-2
00:11:37.934 --> 00:11:42.539
have our own portal but also our
organisation might have their

0e11d3c8-848e-4b2f-91fb-b880100c436b-3
00:11:42.539 --> 00:11:47.218
own portal and so we can access
this here and we can also share

0e11d3c8-848e-4b2f-91fb-b880100c436b-4
00:11:47.218 --> 00:11:50.800
data between the people within
our organisation.

66b7c6b4-4d99-4724-804c-3b969c6b5f7b-0
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:56.560
Within Portal we can also access
the Living Atlas and this is

66b7c6b4-4d99-4724-804c-3b969c6b5f7b-1
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.470
ESRI's own portal where they
have a multitude of data layers

66b7c6b4-4d99-4724-804c-3b969c6b5f7b-2
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:06.540
and maps, for example, that you
can access and use within your

66b7c6b4-4d99-4724-804c-3b969c6b5f7b-3
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.070
Arcgis Pro project.

94b5323e-3215-449e-8a1f-558c03221fa7-0
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:12.867
In favourites you can favourite
any of the items that you're

94b5323e-3215-449e-8a1f-558c03221fa7-1
00:12:12.867 --> 00:12:16.402
using within your project so
that you can use them in the

94b5323e-3215-449e-8a1f-558c03221fa7-2
00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:18.840
future and have a quick access
to them.

114c9832-46de-4333-a471-5d18ee16d2b9-0
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:26.008
And so that's the catalog window
that we have on the right. And

114c9832-46de-4333-a471-5d18ee16d2b9-1
00:12:26.008 --> 00:12:30.585
then just to go over some of the
buttons that we have here at the

114c9832-46de-4333-a471-5d18ee16d2b9-2
00:12:30.585 --> 00:12:35.024
bottom, we have this button here
if we want to choose a certain

114c9832-46de-4333-a471-5d18ee16d2b9-3
00:12:35.024 --> 00:12:37.590
extent to zoom our map in or out
to.

ef7c4922-9c26-4454-a902-63334b308786-0
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:45.435
And then in the middle, these
numbers that keep changing,

ef7c4922-9c26-4454-a902-63334b308786-1
00:12:45.435 --> 00:12:50.026
these are showing us the XY
coordinate of wherever our mouse

ef7c4922-9c26-4454-a902-63334b308786-2
00:12:50.026 --> 00:12:51.080
is on the map.

4c649e75-9ca6-46d6-8d54-656de49e26fb-0
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.961
And so that's it. That's the
main layout of Arcgis Pro with

4c649e75-9ca6-46d6-8d54-656de49e26fb-1
00:12:56.961 --> 00:13:00.785
the main ribbon where you can
access most of the buttons that

4c649e75-9ca6-46d6-8d54-656de49e26fb-2
00:13:00.785 --> 00:13:04.671
you need in the different tabs,
and then also the contents and

4c649e75-9ca6-46d6-8d54-656de49e26fb-3
00:13:04.671 --> 00:13:08.372
the catalogue pane which you're
most likely to have up when

4c649e75-9ca6-46d6-8d54-656de49e26fb-4
00:13:08.372 --> 00:13:10.470
you're working within Arcgis
Pro.
