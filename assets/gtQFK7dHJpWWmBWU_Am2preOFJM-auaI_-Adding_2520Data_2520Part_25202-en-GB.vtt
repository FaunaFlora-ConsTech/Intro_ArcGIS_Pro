00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.180
We will now take a look at the
second method for adding data

2d770022-b48f-4553-a773-009909d60271-1
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.926
into an Arcgis Pro project.
We're going to add data using

2d770022-b48f-4553-a773-009909d60271-2
00:00:08.926 --> 00:00:12.995
this catalog pane here on the
right, and we're going to set up

2d770022-b48f-4553-a773-009909d60271-3
00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:16.935
a folder connection. So to do
this, we're going to hover our

2d770022-b48f-4553-a773-009909d60271-4
00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:20.876
mouse over folders, right click
and then click here where it

2d770022-b48f-4553-a773-009909d60271-5
00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:22.619
says Add Folder Connection.

9944e4df-d898-4fec-bc10-de94672b5cca-0
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.475
And now we want to find our
materials folder again. So I'm

9944e4df-d898-4fec-bc10-de94672b5cca-1
00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:32.494
going into Intro ArcGIS Pro and
then clicking on Materials here

9944e4df-d898-4fec-bc10-de94672b5cca-2
00:00:32.494 --> 00:00:36.638
and we don't need to actually go
into the folder, we just need to

9944e4df-d898-4fec-bc10-de94672b5cca-3
00:00:36.638 --> 00:00:38.460
click on it and then click OK

1d3017b1-a122-467c-86b1-144b0e36536f-0
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.160
And now if we click on the arrow
to the left of where it says

1d3017b1-a122-467c-86b1-144b0e36536f-1
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.981
Folders, we can see we have a
connection here to our Materials

1d3017b1-a122-467c-86b1-144b0e36536f-2
00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:51.499
folder. So we can click the
arrow next to this folder and

1d3017b1-a122-467c-86b1-144b0e36536f-3
00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:53.440
here are all of our data layers.

41129998-a1ed-4daf-9f7e-fe233500ebc5-0
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.281
And now we can drag and drop the
data layers that we want into

41129998-a1ed-4daf-9f7e-fe233500ebc5-1
00:00:59.281 --> 00:00:59.880
our map.

458e848e-9d89-4e53-8c3b-40d0bc8dd477-0
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.406
So here we have dropped in the
Biomonitoring_Ziama2019

458e848e-9d89-4e53-8c3b-40d0bc8dd477-1
00:01:05.406 --> 00:01:06.170
shapefile

c956629f-2765-456c-a06c-53a09f985369-0
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.939
and now we're going to do the
same with the Roads_Tracks

c956629f-2765-456c-a06c-53a09f985369-1
00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.844
shapefile. So what you want to
do is click and hold, drag it

c956629f-2765-456c-a06c-53a09f985369-2
00:01:14.844 --> 00:01:18.813
over and then you can drop it
onto the map or you can drop it

c956629f-2765-456c-a06c-53a09f985369-3
00:01:18.813 --> 00:01:20.029
into your contents.

5b6c8447-0b9e-450a-a574-8e38d7e5dde5-0
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.685
By dropping it into your
contents, you can choose where

5b6c8447-0b9e-450a-a574-8e38d7e5dde5-1
00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:26.080
amongst the data layers you want
to place it.

926aa569-12f9-4d26-b979-9f3c5d9976ea-0
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.860
And we also want to add in
Ziama_DEM.tif

c91088d9-30a3-4102-8583-7fca3a47f094-0
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.450
and Ziama_LandCover_2019.tif.

904916d8-bb63-41e4-9319-ea0db84129e4-0
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.585
And now we can see we've added
our five data layers into our

904916d8-bb63-41e4-9319-ea0db84129e4-1
00:01:47.585 --> 00:01:51.741
project. We can see them on our
map and also in the contents

904916d8-bb63-41e4-9319-ea0db84129e4-2
00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:55.965
pane on the left hand side. And
within this Contents pane, we

904916d8-bb63-41e4-9319-ea0db84129e4-3
00:01:55.965 --> 00:02:00.394
can use the toggle boxes next to
the layer names to turn them on

904916d8-bb63-41e4-9319-ea0db84129e4-4
00:02:00.394 --> 00:02:04.686
and off. And we can also click
and hold on each data layer and

904916d8-bb63-41e4-9319-ea0db84129e4-5
00:02:04.686 --> 00:02:09.114
drag them up and down depending
on where we want them within the

904916d8-bb63-41e4-9319-ea0db84129e4-6
00:02:09.114 --> 00:02:13.338
layers. And that is the second
method for adding data into an

904916d8-bb63-41e4-9319-ea0db84129e4-7
00:02:13.338 --> 00:02:14.019
Arcgis Pro

6a0fab4c-a401-4ef5-beb5-5a5e4475651f-0
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.820
project.
