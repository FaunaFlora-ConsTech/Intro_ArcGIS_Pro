00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.701
So now we've created our layout
and we've added some elements

f0597f0e-1975-4453-85e5-a5c15a8bd593-1
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:06.520
onto our map.

221b6b10-31a9-4853-aba0-63da3d17c448-0
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.920
We're going to go ahead and
export our map.

26b238ae-b3eb-414b-9be4-2103e5f6f114-0
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.283
And so to do this we want to
click on the Share tab in the

26b238ae-b3eb-414b-9be4-2103e5f6f114-1
00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:23.200
main ribbon and then we're
exporting our layout.

d8c1bad5-815c-4526-8dd8-bc84268f0b9d-0
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.488
And so we want to click on
Export Layout and just click on

d8c1bad5-815c-4526-8dd8-bc84268f0b9d-1
00:00:26.488 --> 00:00:28.160
the button, not the drop down.

4132b44e-9097-4ce8-802b-beb81b25d4de-0
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.760
And here we get the Export
layout pane come up.

0408fe09-68d5-4855-a96e-f4106d0bee14-0
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.720
So we're just going to shut the
catalog pane because we don't

0408fe09-68d5-4855-a96e-f4106d0bee14-1
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.440
need that anymore.

6fa08f0b-279c-4a64-adfb-83e2e47c0649-0
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.307
And we'll go over the different
things that are in this export

6fa08f0b-279c-4a64-adfb-83e2e47c0649-1
00:00:38.307 --> 00:00:38.960
layout pane.

aa24fa6c-e8f7-4aa1-9262-de974879b2b0-0
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.842
So the first thing we have is
the file type so we can choose

aa24fa6c-e8f7-4aa1-9262-de974879b2b0-1
00:00:44.842 --> 00:00:46.840
what we want to export it as.

3707d84e-dc15-4ffe-a993-01c9b589ebcf-0
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.710
I'm going to keep it as a jpg
but you could export it as a PDF

3707d84e-dc15-4ffe-a993-01c9b589ebcf-1
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.040
or a PNG for example.

7fa807dc-8520-46e5-a269-5271ba0f05c6-0
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.509
And then the next section we
have is where we're going to

7fa807dc-8520-46e5-a269-5271ba0f05c6-1
00:00:58.509 --> 00:01:03.530
export it to and so by clicking
on the folder button we can now

7fa807dc-8520-46e5-a269-5271ba0f05c6-2
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.080
navigate to our materials folder
to export it into there.

b71f48fc-599b-4368-9a4a-87ff876efaf2-0
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.199
The next button that we have
here is clip to graphics extent

b71f48fc-599b-4368-9a4a-87ff876efaf2-1
00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:21.227
and what this does is it will
remove all the unnecessary white

b71f48fc-599b-4368-9a4a-87ff876efaf2-2
00:01:21.227 --> 00:01:24.680
background that's around our map
and our grid labels.

62066dcb-c9a1-44cc-9796-70154373dfd3-0
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.504
And so we're going to click this
to on and the next thing we have

62066dcb-c9a1-44cc-9796-70154373dfd3-1
00:01:30.504 --> 00:01:33.840
is compression and also the
resolution.

4dc0458e-bbd5-4cc2-8200-da84b80d2100-0
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.788
At the moment these are in
pretty good places so we're

4dc0458e-bbd5-4cc2-8200-da84b80d2100-1
00:01:36.788 --> 00:01:38.840
going to leave them how they
are. Resolution

5e5043ac-a8f2-4826-90c7-d1e2b78a4581-0
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.950
you normally want to choose
between 200 to 300. In JPEG

5e5043ac-a8f2-4826-90c7-d1e2b78a4581-1
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.680
settings

f78a232c-196c-4dd6-acf9-daecde74b4b2-0
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.592
here we can also change the
colour depth to be normal colour

f78a232c-196c-4dd6-acf9-daecde74b4b2-1
00:01:49.592 --> 00:01:50.640
or grayscale.

cb3892fc-2860-4f90-b275-f43cb0464851-0
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.425
We're going to keep it as colour
and we don't need to worry about

cb3892fc-2860-4f90-b275-f43cb0464851-1
00:01:54.425 --> 00:01:56.480
this colour management section
here.

62e7896c-4fa1-4c7f-b0ec-9e93131bfd81-0
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.180
So now we can click export and
this is going to export our map

62e7896c-4fa1-4c7f-b0ec-9e93131bfd81-1
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.120
to the materials folder where we
chose it to go.

63c5dc9f-a804-4f97-ac18-b0042363d1d8-0
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.080
And now it's done.

1485e766-3372-46e1-80f7-07b6640bc365-0
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.480
So we can view our exported file
and there we go.

1a5a252e-88fd-42f8-805c-9a1c00a957ba-0
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.020
There's our JPEG of our exported
map, our exported layout, and we

1a5a252e-88fd-42f8-805c-9a1c00a957ba-1
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.080
can see that it's clipped out
the unnecessary white space.

2cab9a18-1ec0-46e2-8431-08b95456d8a6-0
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.520
And there you go.

aa73684b-9f33-4c89-8948-f61ffe14f7e9-0
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.680
That's how you export a layout
in ArcGIS Pro.
